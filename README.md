# Matilda: Multi-task learning from single-cell multimodal omics

Matilda is a multi-task framework for learning from single-cell multimodal omics data. Matilda leverages the information from the multi-modality of such data and trains a neural network model to simultaneously learn multiple tasks including data simulation, dimension reduction, visualization, classification, and feature selection.
