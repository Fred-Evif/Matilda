Bioinformatics Terms Explanation
================================

+ CITE-seq:
+ High variable genes (HVGs):
+ **Multi-modal/Multi-modality**: Multi-modality here refers to the captured multi-type sequencing data from the same targets in dataset. For example, the RNA sequencing data and ADT data in CITE-seq dataset.
+ Sequencing data/Sequencing: 
+ SHARE-seq:
+ TEA-seq:
