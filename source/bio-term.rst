Bioinformatics Terms Explanation
================================

+ **CITE-seq**: Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing, it is a method for performing RNA sequencing along with gaining quantitative and qualitative information on surface proteins with available antibodies on a single cell level [1]. It provides an additional layer of information for the same cell by combining both proteomics and transcriptomics data.
+ **High variable genes (HVGs)**:
+ **Multi-modal/Multi-modality**: Multi-modality here refers to the captured multi-type sequencing data from the same targets in dataset. For example, the RNA sequencing data and ADT data in single cell provided by CITE-seq dataset.
+ **Sequencing data/Sequencing**: 
+ **SHARE-seq**:
+ **TEA-seq**:
