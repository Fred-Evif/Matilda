Bioinformatics Terms Explanation
================================

+ **CITE-seq**: Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing, it is a method for performing RNA sequencing along with gaining quantitative and qualitative information on surface proteins with available antibodies on a single cell level [1]. It provides an additional layer of information for the same cell by combining both proteomics and transcriptomics data.
+ **High variable genes (HVGs)**: The expression levels of these genes vary greatly between different cells, which are normally considered as the key for identifying the cells.
+ **Multi-modal/Multi-modality**: Multi-modality here refers to the captured multi-type sequencing data from the same targets in dataset. For example, the RNA sequencing data and ADT data in single cell provided by CITE-seq dataset.
+ **Sequencing data/Sequencing**: In genetics and biochemistry, sequencing means to determine the primary structure (sometimes incorrectly called the primary sequence) of an unbranched biopolymer. Sequencing results in a symbolic linear depiction known as a sequence which succinctly summarizes much of the atomic-level structure of the sequenced molecule [2].
+ **SHARE-seq**: Simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing, it is a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same single cell, applicable to different tissues [3]. It provides information combining data of both chromatin Accessibility and transcriptomics.
+ **TEA-seq**: An more advanced technology that measure the Transcriptomic state (scRNA-seq), cell surface Epitopes, and chromatin Accessibility (scATAC-seq) from single cells in  parallel [4]. It provides chromatin Accessibility, proteomics and transcriptomics data at the same time.
