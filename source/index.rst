Welcome to Matilda!
========================================
Matilda is a multi-task framework for learning from single-cell multimodal omics data. It leverages the information from the multi-modality of such data and trains a neural network model to simultaneously learn multiple tasks including data simulation, dimension reduction, visualization, classification, and feature selection. 

If you find a model useful for your research, please consider citing it (publication_).
