Welcome to Matilda!
========================================
Matilda is a multi-task framework for learning from single-cell multimodal omics data. It leverages the information from the multi-modality of such data and trains a neural network model to simultaneously learn multiple tasks including data simulation, dimension reduction, visualization, classification, and feature selection. It is kept maintaining and updating by the Pengyi Lab at CMRI in Australia.

If you find a model useful for your eresearch, please consider citing the Matilda manuscript_ and the publication_  describing it.
